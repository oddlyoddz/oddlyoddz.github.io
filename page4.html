 <h1>Graduating Class of 2013</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>2013</h2>
  <p>
    Hahaha! So, come join us back in Morvato for your graduation which is planned for this upcoming Friday! Plans for the summer? Going to college in the fall? Gap year perhaps? Maybe you don't want to go to school ever again! Do your parents respect your wishes of what you want to do after high school or maybe they are forcing you into a random family business that you have absolutely no interest in. Whatever it may be, great that you get to celebrate it in Morvato, America's Most Normal Town(awarded in 2005). After the whole prom fiasco, you learned a little more about your classmates. Is everyone here who they say they are? Could there potentially be something brewing and going to affect your graduation? Have your classmates always been in this town? Do you even know them? Is there proof they actually exist? Are they lying? Or perhaps they don't know it yet? Do you even know it yet? Who are you? Are you real?
    <br>
    <br>
    For now, you are still stinky teenagers going to Morvato High!
