I hope everything is going alright, dear, on your business trip. I am just holding down the fort here hahah. That is supposed to be a joke. I cannot help but, freak out while I am awaiting you. The neighbors have seemed a little more, might I say, "trigger happy?". It's not the corect word but, I am not sure how else to describe the feeling. They seem like they are on high alert whenever I am going to the mail box, taking out the trash, mowing the lawn or just going out for the day. There always happens to either be someone on the porch or inside looking out the window. Perhaps, I am just a little paranoid?

  <p>It's been about a week of this happening and you know how I told you about what I saw the other night before you left? Strange things are happening at Morvato. I was talking to Mrs. Blair about it and she told me about how she could've sworn she saw a thing with horns when she woke up in her room. She blinked and then the figure disappeared. It was horrifying to hear about! Her experience reminded me of that other night and are reminding me of our neighbors currently. I know we keep saying our kid is just having night terrors, but, I am worried our kid is actually telling the truth of what she is seeing at night. Please if you read this letter, come home soon. </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <p2> they're watching me. </p2>

  <p>I can feel their eyes on me, even while I am writing this in the comfort of our home. I am going to write about something else right now so maybe, they will stop staring at me haha. Yesterday I went out for a pleasant walk with Mr. and Mrs. Campbells. We had a lovely time until Tony tripped on a rock and fell on Jennifer! It was hysterical but, I made sure they were both okay. We went to go get some food at the mall afterwards! Did you know that they just added a nifty ice rink in the mall? In time for the holidays! But, you already know how awful I am at ice skating hahaha! One day, I'll become just like Dorothy Hamill haha </p>

  <p>hypocrite of you to trust the chemicals in your brain to tell you they are chemicals. All knowledge is ultimately based on that which we cannot prove. Will you fight? or will you perish like a dog?</p>
