  I hope everything is going alright, dear, on your business trip. I am just holding down the fort here hahah. That is supposed to be a joke. I cannot help but freak out while I am awaiting you. The neighbors seemed a little more, might I say, "trigger happy?". It's not the correct word but I am not sure how else to describe the feeling. They seem like they are on high alert whenever I am going to the mailbox, taking out the trash, mowing the lawn or just going out for the day. There always happens to either be someone on the porch or inside looking out the window. I cannot even go out to get the daily newspaper and sit on my rocking chair on the front porch to read it. Even today, I went to get groceries at the Morvato Grocery Store and all of a sudden, I spotted their child alone in the cereal aisle. She ran away afterwards but it was such an odd coincidence. Theyâ€™ve been speaking very flat whenever I try to engage with them, they look the same yet not at the same time? Perhaps, I am just a little paranoid?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
  <p>It's been about a week of this happening and you know how I told you about what I saw the other night before you left? Strange things are happening at Morvato. I was talking to Mrs. Blair about it and she told me about how she could've sworn she saw a thing with horns when she woke up in her room. She blinked and then the figure disappeared. It was horrifying to hear about! Her experience reminded me of that other night and is reminding me of our neighbors currently.  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>I know we keep saying our kid is just having night terrors, but I am worried our kid is actually telling the truth of what she is seeing at night.  She keeps telling me about how she thinks some sort of monster is going to grab her at night and eat her if she keeps misbehaving. I agree she should stop misbehaving but, I do not want to scare our child to death especially since we did not plant that idea in her head. Now she has been sleeping in my room all worried and scared. I know you told me to go talk to a doctor about how I am feeling before you left but, I am worried they will put me into one of those crazy people hospitals , especially not the one in Sans. I am not crazy. I know what I saw. Please if you read this letter, come home soon.</p>

  <p>I can feel their eyes on me, even while I am writing this in the comfort of our home. I am going to write about something else right now so maybe, they will stop staring at me haha. Yesterday I went out for a pleasant walk with Mr. and Mrs. Campbells. We had a lovely time until Tony tripped on a rock and fell on Jennifer! It was hysterical but, I made sure they were both okay. We went to go get some food at the mall afterwards! Did you know that they just added a nifty ice rink in the mall? In time for the holidays! But, you already know how awful I am at ice skating hahaha! One day, I'll become just like Dorothy Hamill haha </p>

  <p>hypocrite of you to trust the chemicals in your brain to tell you they are chemicals. All knowledge is ultimately based on that which we cannot prove. Will you fight? or will you perish like a dog?</p>
