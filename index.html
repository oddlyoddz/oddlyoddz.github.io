 <h1>Graduating Class of 2013</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>hooray</h2>
  <p>
    Toss those prom dresses back into the closet and celebrate your upcoming graduation ceremony in a week! Fast and Furious 6 just came out this Friday along with Epic and the Hangover part III. Smosh also just released their latest hit “Dixon Cider” and are celebrating hitting 10 million subscribers on Youtube. In the current events, “The Boy Scouts of America have voted to allow gay youth to join”, Microsoft has just recently announced the “Xbox One” and North Korea has announced there is a bird flu and has authorized military personnel to kill over 160,000 ducks. The month of May has surprisingly had a bunch of violence in the world from protests being overrun and a bunch of attempts to blow up schools/fellow classmates.
    Kind of makes you scared for your future, doesn't it? Especially with your adult life starting soon once you leave Morvato High. But fret not, as Morvato is a completely normal town! :D

Especially on the best night of everyones lives so far? Your class has been waiting for this prom so how dare someone try to ruin it!!?? :(( But you managed to stop her! Yay!
